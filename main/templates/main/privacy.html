        <h2>What information Tick blog Community collects and Why</h2>
        <p>
          In order to give you the best possible experience using Tick blog
          community, we collect information from your interactions with our
          network. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web
          server logs. We collect this basic information from everybody, whether
          they have an account or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The visitor's browser type</li>
          <li>Referring site</li>
          <li>The date and time of each visitor request</li>
          <li>
            We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like
            Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide, test, improve, promote and personalize Tick blog Community
            Services
          </li>
          <li>Fight spam and other forms of abuse</li>
          <li>
            Generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use
            Tick blog Community Services
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In order for you to create an account on Tick blog Community and use our
          Services, we need to collect and process certain information.
          Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for
            support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);
          </li>
          <li>
            Information that you submit on or to Tick blog Community in the form
            of reactions, comments, or messages to other users;
          </li>
          <li>
            The email address associated with your Twitter account, if you
            choose to sign up using your Twitter credentials. Tick blog Community
            will also request permission to access additional information (these
            permissions are governed by Twitter's privacy policies and can be
            managed through your Twitter privacy settings). We never post
            anything to your Twitter without your permission.
          </li>
          <li>
            The email address associated with your GitHub account, if you choose
            to sign up using your Github credentials. Tick blog Community will
            also request permission to access additional information (these
            permissions are governed by GitHub's privacy policies and can be
            managed through your GitHub privacy settings). We never post
            anything to your GitHub without your permission.
          </li>
          <li>
            You also have the option to give us more information if you want to,
            and this may include “User Personal Information.”

      <section class="section-two">
        <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with
          third parties for commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information
          with others about how our users, collectively, use Tick blog Community.
          For example, we may share information pertaining to the popularity of
          different programming languages for advertising partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do host first-party advertising on Tick blog Community. We do not run
          any code from advertisers and all ad images are hosted on managed Tick
          blog Community servers. For more details, see our section on
          <a href="#advertising">Advertising Details</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use User Personal Information with your permission, so we can
          perform services you have authorized.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third
          party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our
          service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our
          own Privacy Statement. Our third party vendors are listed below.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="section-three">
        <h2 id="advertising">Advertising Details</h2>
        <p>We target advertisements based solely upon:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Details of the page where the advertisement is shown, including:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The name and keywords associated with the page or article being
              viewed
            </li>
            <li>
              We allow advertisers to target ads to a list of keywords
              advertising.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>We may place ads in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sidebars</li>
          <li>Below articles</li>
          <li>On search result pages</li>
          <li>On tag pages</li>
          <li>Our dedicated Sponsors page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All registered members have the ability to disable advertisements —
          where reasonable — through their Settings page. For instance, it's not
          feasible to disable certain advertisements in the form of recognition
          posts, site-wide contests, dedicated sponsorship page, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Third Party Vendors</h3>
        <p>
          We may share your account information with third parties in some
          circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service
          provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) for
          survey or research purposes, after aggregation, anonymization, or
          pseudonymization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required
          by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5)
          when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent
          imminent harm to someone.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Tick blog Community uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for
          hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we
          need to run Tick blog Community. By using Tick blog Community Services,
          you authorize Tick blog Community to transfer, store, and use your
          information in the United States and any other country where we
          operate. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to
          meet our data protection standards.
        </p>

        <h3>Site monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          Tick blog Community uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose
          errors and improve the performance of our site. We aim to minimize the
          amount of personal information shared, but the information may include
          your IP address or other identifying information. All service
          providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data
          protection standards.
        </p>

        <h3>Payment processing</h3>
        <p>
          Tick blog Community does not process payments directly — we rely on
          third-party services such as Stripe, Shopify, and Paypal to receive
          payments and store any payment information.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-Party Embeds</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the content that you see displayed on Tick blog Community is not
          hosted by Tick blog Community. These “embeds” are hosted by a
          third-party and embedded in Tick blog Community. For example: YouTube
          videos, Codepens, Twitter tweets, or GitHub code that appear within
          aTick blog Community post. These files send data to the hosted site just
          as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load
          aTick blog Community post page with a YouTube video embedded in it,
          YouTube receives data about your activity). Tick blog Community does not
          control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what
          they will do with it. Third-party embeds on Tick blog Community are not
          covered by this privacy policy; they are covered by the privacy policy
          of the third-party service. Be mindful when interacting with these
          services.
        </p>

        <h3>Tracking & Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when
          you return to our Services. Third-party vendors may also use cookies
          for various reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tick blog Community uses a specific cookie in order to facilitate the
          use of Google Universal Analytics for users logged-in to the
          Applications or the Platforms (“Logged-In User). If you are a
          Logged-In User, Tick blog Community may use your Tick blog Community user
          ID in combination with Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics
          to track and analyze the pages of the Services you visit. We do this
          only to better understand how you use the Website and the other
          Services, with a view to offering improvements for all Tick blog
          Community users; and to tailor our business and marketing activities
          accordingly, both generally and specifically to you. Google Analytics
          cookies do not provide Tick blog Community with any Personal
          Information.You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on
          return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may opt-out of this feature by installing the Google Analytics
          Opt-out Browser Add-on, by setting your web browser to refuse cookies,
          or by setting your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent.
          If you do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function
          properly.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>
          We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from
          our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100%
          secure, so we can't guarantee security. You use the Service at your
          own risk, and you're responsible for taking reasonable measures to
          secure your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes we'll send you emails about your account, service changes or
          new policies. You can't opt out of this type of “transactional” email
          (unless you delete your account).
        </p>
        <p>
          When you interact with a transactional email sent from Tick blog
          Community (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link
          in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-administrative Emails from Tick blog Community</h3>
        <p>
          Upon creating a Tick blog Community account, you will be opted into the
          Tick blog Community Newsletter and other non-administrative email. Your
          email address and user profile information may be stored by a
          third-party email provider such as MailChimp or Sendgrid. You can opt
          out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and
          activity notifications through your account's “Settings” page and at
          the link of the footer in any non-administrative email you receive
          from us.
